# Egg Timer app

Timer in which you can keep track of your time which is fitted in a fun animated egg shell. In this we can set the time of a timer using a seekBar and as soon as we press the button "GO!" The timer will start running and seekbar will get diable and text of the button will change to stop. And when the timer goes off a sound will play of a car horn to represent that time set on timer is over and as soon as timer sound will be pkayed all buttons and seekbar will get reset.

## New things I learnt

I first time worked with timer and leanred various new concepts as changing texts of a button and enabling and disbling seekbar. I connected all of them together and also figure out the logic of milliseconds to convert into seconds and then into minutes.
